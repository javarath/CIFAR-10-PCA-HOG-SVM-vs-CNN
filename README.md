# CIFAR-10-PCA-HOG-SVM-vs-CNN
This repository contains two approaches for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The first approach utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The second approach employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
